This is a project to help me learn Node. The goal is to create a blog application in as much vanilla Node as possible. A great question is why would I do this to myself and why not use something like Express and not reinvent the wheel? My thought process for this is that I believe I will gain a better understanding of Node this way and will gain an idea and better appreciation for what's going on under the hood in something like Express. After I do a vanilla Node application the plan will be to learn Express and the other tools that will help me but I think I will have a better foundational understanding of Node when I do.
